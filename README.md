# open-data-assignment
The open-data-assignment is one of the Ionic3 projects I developed in February 2019. <br>
It is an open data application using the API from MusicDemons (https://musicdemons.com/api). <br>
The app shows all artists and corresponding songs the API provides. For visualizing the data, JavaScript graph library is used.
